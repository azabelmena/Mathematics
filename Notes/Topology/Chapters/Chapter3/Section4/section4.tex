\section{Compact Spaces.}

\begin{definition}
    A collection $\Ac=\{A_{\alpha}\}$ of subsets of a topological space $X$ is said to be a  \textbf{cover}, or a
    \textbf{covering} of $X$ if  $\bigcup{A}=X$. We call $\{A\}$ an \textbf{open cover} if each $A$
    is open in  $X$. If  $\{A'\}$ is a subcollection of $\Ac$ that also covers $X$, we call
    $\{A'\}$ a \textbf{subcover} of $X$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
    We call a topological space $X$ \textbf{compact} if for every open cover of $X$, there is a
    finite subcover of $X$.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\arabic*)]
        \item     $\R$ is not compact. Consider the following cover of  $\R$:
            \begin{equation*}
                \Ac=\{(n,n+2):n \in \Z\}
            \end{equation*}
            however, there is no finite subcollection of $\Ac$ that is a subcover of  $\R$.

        \item The subspace $X=\{0\} \cup \{\frac{1}{n}: n \in \Z\}$ of $\R$ is compact. Let  $\Ac$
            be a cover of  $X$. There is a  $U \in \Ac$ with  $0 \in U$ and $U$ contains all but
            finitely many of the points  $ \frac{1}{n}$. Now choose for each $\frac{1}{n} \in
            \com{X}{U}$ an element of $\Ac$ $A_{n}$ containing it. Then for all $n$,  $\{A_n\}$ is
            finite and covers $X$.

        \item If  $X$ is a finite topological space, then it is compact, since every open cover of
            $X$ is finite.

        \item The interval  $(0,1]$ is not compact. The open cover $\Ac=\{(\frac{1}{n}, 1]: n \in
            \Z^+\}$ contains no finite subcollection of $\Ac$ that covers  $(0,1]$. Likewise,
            $(0,1)$ is not compact by the same argument. However, $[0,1]$ is compact.
    \end{enumerate}
 
\end{example}
